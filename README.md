# Data Structures and Algorithms Using Python 🐍

This repository contains clean, modular implementations of fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms using Python. Designed for interview preparation, academic revision, and practical understanding of core CS concepts.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Tools:** VS Code, Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## ✨ What's Inside

- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees (Binary, BST, AVL), Graphs (DFS/BFS, Dijkstra)
- Sorting (Merge, Quick, Heap), Searching
- Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Backtracking
- Real-world coding patterns and problems

## 📦 How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PriyaJ31/dsa-python.git
cd dsa-python
python3 file_name.py  # Replace with actual filename
